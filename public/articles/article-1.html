<h3>A mixed-level dance class can fascilitate learning and reduce stress</h3>

<p> Dancers tend to look at each other and potentially copy each other. To some people, this might sound like a commonly
    known fact. However, Donna Davenport (2017) states that many truths about academic dance stay hidden behind a dance
    studio's doors and are not valued further. One of these truths is that copying nearby standing dancers should not be
    understood as cheating (Davenport, 2017). Unfortunately, from my experience, this is not always taken as a positive
    thing. If you are a student in a dance class, teachers often say you should not copy and focus only on yourself.
    That you should believe in yourself and don't let your shifty eyes look anywhere else than at yourself. However, the
    research I undertook shows that copying other students is not as much about believing in yourself as about the fact
    that dancers just know they need a little bit more of a lead and direction. Therefore, I prefer to call this
    'observing' rather than 'copying'.</p>

This is the thing with a mixed-level dance class. The beginners will often look at the advanced dancers, not to copy them but simply to check if they do it similarly to them (see tab. 1 for the dance levels of participants). Because they believe that the advanced dancers have had more practice and therefore have greater knowledge about how it should be done. They look and compare and try to learn more from what they see. One of the participants (Participant 4) in the research said: 'When we danced ballet, I permanently looked at [Participant 1] because she was like next to me and I knew she is good with it.. so… But it was terrific to have them [the advanced dancers] among ourselves because I needed something with a closer look, and you [the teacher] were too far away. For example, I looked at how she bends the toes on her feet….and then I tried to do it similarly.' (see pic. 1) According to this example, students observing advanced dancers may have more potential to learn as the dance teacher might not always be reachable. Moreover, data analyses of my research show that this 'observing' can help dancers manage their stress in dance class, creating a feeling of inclusion.

<p>Research has consistently shown that dance can improve dancers' mental states and support health through stress
    reduction and others (Mavrovouniotis <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Sivvas <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Bond, 2014; Connolly <em>et
        al.</em>, 2011; Malkogeorgos <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Alpert, 2010; Quiroga Murcia <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Hanna,
    2006; Jeong <em>et al.</em> 2005; Pennedo and Dahn, 2005; Jackson <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Snyder, 2001; Brown and
    Lawton, 1987). As Hanna (2006) describes it, 'dance is a language-like form of human culture that helps individuals
    to manage stress' (p.5). She argues that people are more likely to lower stress through dance than other forms of
    exercise because it consists of 'distinct physical dimensions, affective patterns and non-verbal communication'
    (p.14). Nevertheless, as shown in my research, there are also examples of dancers feeling low during a dance class
    because of different factors concentrated there - these can be, for example, the stress of not knowing the exercise,
    meeting new people, or having a feeling of not performing well (Frichtel, 2017). Moreover, the pressure in a dance
    class can be affected by gender, grade/year, the number of practice hours per week and most importantly, years of
    experience (Huang <em>et al.</em>, 2022). This brings attention to the problem that stressed dancers or people
    overall are less likely to be focused, learn and feel safe and included (Fox & Lindwall, 2017). As shown in the
    research by Samantha Sobash (2012), dancers might also get pressured to perform well during other activities such as
    dance competitions. Samantha explored the psychology of competitive dance regarding young students, who come to
    dance classes after school and often are pushed to start competing at age 4. Followingly, the emerging stress and
    anxiety cause a lower quality performance and often result in dancers quitting rather than continuing with such a
    mindset (Sobash, 2012). </p>

<p>The pressure which might occur in dance classes can also be seen in the comment of Participant 4, when he, as a
    beginner, was standing in front of an advanced dancer and could not see what she was doing. Participant 4: 'I was
    pressured when we switched [by the barre], like when we turned, and then I was like oh my god, don't look at me, I
    am scared. And everything I did was wrong. I forgot where to put my feet, and I was really nervous. I didn't feel
    like I should be in that class.' </p>

<p>I suggest finding ways to lower stress during a dance class is beneficial. Luckily, the data analyses of my research
    show that observing might be one of the ways to make students feel less stressed and included. The study shows that
    especially beginner or intermediate students are less likely to feel nervous and depressed if they can check with
    the person standing next to them if they are doing the movement right. Some participants commented that they feel
    'comfortable and part of the group'.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the pressure participants avoid, thanks to observing the other students, might come into play when
    they think they are being monitored by the other students the same way they were following them before. In our case,
    this made the previously mentioned participant 4 nervous because he knew he did not execute the exercise
    exceptionally well. Nevertheless, this research also shows that the more advanced dancer you become, the less you
    tend to observe others. So, in the end, the worries of participant 4 were not necessary at all. As shown by more
    advanced dancers, who took part in the research, once dancers reach a certain level of professionality, they know
    how things should be done and move the focus from the external to the internal. Observe only themselves and try to
    feel the movement rather than look around. Similar behaviour of performers can also be seen in research done by Land
    <em>et al.</em> (2013) and Pascua <em>et al.</em> (2015), who all researched benefits of an external focus on
    performers. According to them, except for some elite professionals, performers who are not instructed to use their
    internal or external focus tend to naturally use the internal one and pay attention only to their own movements
    (Pascua <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Land <em>et al.</em>, 2013). </p>

<p>So, it can be seen that no advanced dancers in this research project were observing others while executing the
    movement or exercise. Thanks to that, it can be concluded that dancers in a mixed-level dance lesson can benefit
    from this situation by learning from each other. Nevertheless, it works only in one direction: beginners learning
    from intermediate or advanced dancers or also intermediate dancers learning from advanced dancers but not the other
    way around.</p>

<h3>A mixed level dance classs can create a positive atmosphere </h3>

<p>The ways how the dancers' welfare might be influenced by a social environment remains more on the unexplored side
    (Quested & Duda, 2010), although dance is a social matter (Sivvas <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Malkogeorgos <em>et
        al.</em>, 2011; Alpert, 2010; Hanna, 2006). Dance develops social skills and encourages students to integrate
    with the help of verbal or non-verbal communication ( Panagiotopoulou, 2017; Kourkouta <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Lee
    <em>et al.</em>, 2002). My research appears to show signs of how social interaction in the dance class influences
    dancers' mental state - in this case, making dancers feel good. Research done by Panagiotopoulou (2017) even shows
    that dance classes and the students' interaction within them can serve as a therapy place in the school environment.
    Panagiotopoulou (2017) started this research as the first ever in a Greek public school and describes how this use
    of dance contributes to the development of the social and emotional skills of the students. One of the most notable
    examples of the results of his research is a finding where a few students who were not able to collaborate with
    others and were not part of the team at the beginning of the research slowly managed to integrate towards the end of
    the research period (Panagiotopoulou, 2017).</p>

<p>Furhtermore, from my research, similarly to the one pursued by Tanja Råman (2009), named 'Collaborative learning in
    the dance technique class', it can be seen that the social interaction between dancers in a dance class is closely
    related to the environment, potentially the atmosphere created by the teacher and students. Generally, both
    atmosphere types - positive or negative, would have a considerable effect on students as well as the teacher.
    Presumably, the positive type is more desirable as it brings to the surface positive reactions of the dancers.
    However, to support a positive atmosphere in the dance class, there must be opportunities for students´ interaction,
    such as verbal or non-verbal communication. One example of such an interaction can be seen in Råman's study (2009).
    While Råman's primary purpose of the research was to promote students' critical thinking while enhancing the
    learning of a dance technique, it became apparent that ´pair work´ in a dance class creates a positive learning
    environment (Råman, 2009). Overall, from the data analyses of my research, there seems to be a large number of
    opportunities for these kinds of interactions in a mixed-level dance class.</p>

<p>My research shows that dancers tend to chat with each other more if they are unsure what to do. It is because,
    usually, dancers try to figure out how to do the exercise or movement through shared efforts. Sharing knowledge
    makes them approach each other, discuss, smile and sometimes even laugh. It supports interaction. Consequently,
    creating a positive and pleasant atmosphere to which they all belong.</p>

<p>Comments from the research participants smiling at each other while sorting out movements together were overflowing.
    One of them looks like this - Participant 7: 'I think that in the ballet specifically, it was fun because like
    [Participant 1] said, we were trying to figure out what we have to do as a group, yeah. And me and [Participant 5],
    we were non-stop talking about what we are supposed to do, which leg should we use or…yeah, it was, it was really
    funny… yeah. And in the hip-hop, I think it was like the general atmosphere in which everyone was smiling and looked
    like they were enjoying themselves.' After the analyses of all similar comments to this one, it can be suggested
    that if dancers are encouraged to verbally communicate with each other in a mixed-level dance class, it positively
    influences their mental health, as it creates a positive atmosphere (Råman, 2009), which then makes them feel
    relaxed, included and happy (Keyes <em>et al.</em>, 2020).</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is not all so simple. There is always the other side of the story. For this to happen, the teacher
    needs to allow it and create an environment where everyone feels like they are entitled to speak, consult, ask, say
    their own opinion or even laugh. (link to the other article) In my research, it became apparent that for the
    duration of the quasi-experiment, teachers always allowed this kind of atmosphere. However, from the comments of
    participants, it was visible that if they had not done it, the atmosphere would most certainly sink.</p>

<p>

</figure>
On the other side, as seen in research by Peter A. Hastie and Andrew Pickwell (1996), such a free environment can not be offered every time. Their study discusses a social system of young students learning dance as part of their school curriculum. Moreover, it shows that most of the students were trying to avoid any dance activity for the majority of the duration of the dance class. The environment the teacher offered was not closely as relaxed and free as the one in my research. So, it can be assumed that if it had been, the students would just take advantage of it and would not dance at all. It is necessary to mention that these students were 16-17 years old and members of the 11th grade (Hastie & Pickwell, 1996). In comparison to that, the participants of my study were all over 18 years old and were not part of any compulsory dance activities (see tab. 2).</p>

<p>For dancers feeling relaxed and happy is necessary not to feel embarrassed. Which, unfortunately, happens quite often
    in dance classes (Peter A. Hastie and Andrew Pickwell, 1996). Dancers can frequently be nervous, scared, or
    pressured to do well (Frichtel, 2017; Sobash, 2012). Especially if they think they are worse than the rest of the
    group. This has already been commented on in the first section of this article by participant 4 (link to that
    section). Likely, it is noticeable from participant 2 sharing his previous dance learning experiences: 'Everyone in
    the class has been above...level above...or just high level. And so then you feel like not as good, I guess. You
    feel a bit nervous.'</p>

<p>It might seem that this feeling of being a poor dancer appears even more often in a mixed-level class because the
    level of dancing is much broader. Nevertheless, it does not have to. My research shows that those feelings weaken or
    even completely evaporate if everyone in the dance class has someone in a similar situation. This research was full
    of participants of various dance levels, where each beginner or advanced dancer had at least one other person on the
    same level (see tab. 1). And that's precisely it. The research showed that if each person in the class has another
    one in the same situation, they can discuss it and laugh about it together rather than be crunching alone in the
    corner trying to hide from all the 'super-trained' advanced dancers. Therefore, I suggest that in a mixed-level
    dance class, there should always be at least two people of one' dance level' so that everybody has a buddy.</p>

<p>The only exception for not suffering this 'poor dancer' complex in a mixed-level dance class is the intermediate
    group. My research shows that because intermediate dancers find themselves somewhere in the middle of beginners and
    advanced dancers, they don't feel such a need for another intermediate dancer to be in the same class with them.
    They do not feel as bad as, evidently, there is someone worse than them as well as better than them. Yet, I suggest
    this applies only to feelings of nervousness, fear and pressure. It is not clear from my research if it necessarily
    covers the loneliness, which might appear to a dancer at any stage of dance level without a buddy and generally
    influence emotional, cognitive and behavioural functioning (Taylor <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Coyle and Dugan, 2012;
    Holt-Lunstad <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Hawkley and Cacioppo, 2003).</p>

<p>That said, all participants in the research mentioned that they were coming to this research with a positive mindset
    and ready to have some fun. So even though the study shows that a mixed-level dance class can create a positive
    atmosphere and make dancers feel good, it is necessary to take it with a pinch of salt as not every dance class is
    done the same way and with the same mindset and preparation as was the one for the research purposes.</p>
