<h3>Dancers can learn from each other while lowering their stress level</h3>
<p>Dancers tend to look at each other and potentially copy each other. To some people, this might sound like a commonly known fact. However, Donna Davenport (2017) states that many truths about academic dance stay hidden behind a dance studio's doors and are not valued further. One of these truths is that copying nearby standing dancers should not be understood as cheating (Davenport, 2017). Unfortunately, from my experience, this is not always taken as a positive thing. If you are a student in a dance class, teachers often say you should not copy and focus only on yourself. That you should believe in yourself and don't let your shifty eyes look anywhere else than at yourself. However, the research I undertook shows that copying other students is not as much about believing in yourself as about the fact that dancers just know they need a little bit more of a lead and direction. Therefore, I prefer to call this 'observing' rather than 'copying'.</p>

    This is the thing with a mixed-level dance class. The beginners will often look at the advanced dancers, not to copy them but simply to check if they do it similarly to them (see tab. 1) for the dance levels of participants). Because they believe that the advanced dancers have had more practice and therefore have greater knowledge about how it should be done. They look and compare and try to learn more from what they see. One of the participants (Participant 4) in the research said: 'When we danced ballet, I permanently looked at [Participant 1] because she was like next to me and I knew she is good with it.. so… But it was terrific to have them [the advanced dancers] among ourselves because I needed something with a closer look, and you [the teacher] were too far away. For example, I looked at how she bends the toes on her feet….and then I tried to do it similarly.' (see pic. 1) According to this example, students observing advanced dancers may have more potential to learn as the dance teacher might not always be reachable. Moreover, data analyses of my research show that this 'observing' can help dancers manage their stress in dance class, creating a feeling of inclusion.

<p>Research has consistently shown that dance can improve dancers' mental states and support health through stress reduction and others (Mavrovouniotis <em>et al.</em>, 2016; Sivvas <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Bond, 2014; Connolly <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Malkogeorgos <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Alpert, 2010; Quiroga Murcia <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Hanna, 2006; Jeong <em>et al.</em> 2005; Pennedo and Dahn, 2005; Jackson <em>et al.</em>, 2004; Snyder, 2001; Brown and Lawton, 1987). As Hanna (2006) describes it, 'dance is a language-like form of human culture that helps individuals to manage stress' (p.5). She argues that people are more likely to lower stress through dance than other forms of exercise because it consists of 'distinct physical dimensions, affective patterns and non-verbal communication' (p.14). Nevertheless, as shown in my research, there are also examples of dancers feeling low during a dance class because of different factors concentrated there - these can be, for example, the stress of not knowing the exercise, meeting new people, or having a feeling of not performing well (Frichtel, 2017). Moreover, the pressure in a dance class can be affected by gender, grade/year, the number of practice hours per week and most importantly, years of experience (Huang <em>et al.</em>, 2022). This brings attention to the problem that stressed dancers or people overall are less likely to be focused, learn and feel safe and included (Fox & Lindwall, 2017). As shown in the research by Samantha Sobash (2012), dancers might also get pressured to perform well during other activities such as dance competitions. Samantha explored the psychology of competitive dance regarding young students, who come to dance classes after school and often are pushed to start competing at age 4. Followingly, the emerging stress and anxiety cause a lower quality performance and often result in dancers quitting rather than continuing with such a mindset (Sobash, 2012). </p>

<p>The pressure which might occur in dance classes can also be seen in the comment of Participant 4, when he, as a beginner, was standing in front of an advanced dancer and could not see what she was doing. Participant 4: 'I was pressured when we switched [by the barre], like when we turned, and then I was like oh my god, don't look at me, I am scared. And everything I did was wrong. I forgot where to put my feet, and I was really nervous. I didn't feel like I should be in that class.' </p>

<p>I suggest finding ways to lower stress during a dance class is beneficial. Luckily, the data analyses of my research show that observing might be one of the ways to make students feel less stressed and included. The study shows that especially beginner or intermediate students are less likely to feel nervous and depressed if they can check with the person standing next to them if they are doing the movement right. Some participants commented that they feel 'comfortable and part of the group'.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the pressure participants avoid, thanks to observing the other students, might come into play when they think they are being monitored by the other students the same way they were following them before. In our case, this made the previously mentioned participant 4 nervous because he knew he did not execute the exercise exceptionally well. Nevertheless, this research also shows that the more advanced dancer you become, the less you tend to observe others. So, in the end, the worries of participant 4 were not necessary at all. As shown by more advanced dancers, who took part in the research, once dancers reach a certain level of professionality, they know how things should be done and move the focus from the external to the internal. Observe only themselves and try to feel the movement rather than look around. Similar behaviour of performers can also be seen in research done by Land <em>et al.</em> (2013) and Pascua <em>et al.</em> (2015), who all researched benefits of an external focus on performers. According to them, except for some elite professionals, performers who are not instructed to use their internal or external focus tend to naturally use the internal one and pay attention only to their own movements (Pascua <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Land <em>et al.</em>, 2013). </p>

<p>So, it can be seen that no advanced dancers in this research project were observing others while executing the movement or exercise. Thanks to that, it can be concluded that dancers in a mixed-level dance lesson can benefit from this situation by learning from each other. Nevertheless, it works only in one direction: beginners learning from intermediate or advanced dancers or also intermediate dancers learning from advanced dancers but not the other way around. </p>

<h3>It creates a positive atmosphere </h3>

<p>The ways how the dancers' welfare might be influenced by a social environment remains more on the unexplored side (Quested & Duda, 2010), although dance is a social matter (Sivvas <em>et al.</em>, 2015; Malkogeorgos <em>et al.</em>, 2011; Alpert, 2010; Hanna, 2006). Dance develops social skills and encourages students to integrate with the help of verbal or non-verbal communication ( Panagiotopoulou, 2017; Kourkouta <em>et al.</em>, 2014; Lee <em>et al.</em>, 2002). My research appears to show signs of how social interaction in the dance class influences dancers' mental state - in this case, making dancers feel good. Research done by Panagiotopoulou (2017) even shows that dance classes and the students' interaction within them can serve as a therapy place in the school environment. Panagiotopoulou (2017) started this research as the first ever in a Greek public school and describes how this use of dance contributes to the development of the social and emotional skills of the students. One of the most notable examples of the results of his research is a finding where a few students who were not able to collaborate with others and were not part of the team at the beginning of the research slowly managed to integrate towards the end of the research period (Panagiotopoulou, 2017).</p>

<p>Furhtermore, from my research, similarly to the one pursued by Tanja Råman (2009), named 'Collaborative learning in the dance technique class', it can be seen that the social interaction between dancers in a dance class is closely related to the environment, potentially the atmosphere created by the teacher and students. Generally, both atmosphere types - positive or negative, would have a considerable effect on students as well as the teacher. Presumably, the positive type is more desirable as it brings to the surface positive reactions of the dancers. However, to support a positive atmosphere in the dance class, there must be opportunities for students´ interaction, such as verbal or non-verbal communication. One example of such an interaction can be seen in Råman's study (2009). While Råman's primary purpose of the research was to promote students' critical thinking while enhancing the learning of a dance technique, it became apparent that ´pair work´ in a dance class creates a positive learning environment (Råman, 2009). Overall, from the data analyses of my research, there seems to be a large number of opportunities for these kinds of interactions in a mixed-level dance class.</p>  

<p>My research shows that dancers tend to chat with each other more if they are unsure what to do. It is because, usually, dancers try to figure out how to do the exercise or movement through shared efforts. Sharing knowledge makes them approach each other, discuss, smile and sometimes even laugh. It supports interaction. Consequently, creating a positive and pleasant atmosphere to which they all belong.</p>

<p>Comments from the research participants smiling at each other while sorting out movements together were overflowing. One of them looks like this - Participant 7: 'I think that in the ballet specifically, it was fun because like [Participant 1] said, we were trying to figure out what we have to do as a group, yeah. And me and [Participant 5], we were non-stop talking about what we are supposed to do, which leg should we use or…yeah, it was, it was really funny… yeah. And in the hip-hop, I think it was like the general atmosphere in which everyone was smiling and looked like they were enjoying themselves.' After the analyses of all similar comments to this one, it can be suggested that if dancers are encouraged to verbally communicate with each other in a mixed-level dance class, it positively influences their mental health, as it creates a positive atmosphere (Råman, 2009), which then makes them feel relaxed, included and happy (Keyes <em>et al.</em>, 2020).</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is not all so simple. There is always the other side of the story. For this to happen, the teacher needs to allow it and create an environment where everyone feels like they are entitled to speak, consult, ask, say their own opinion or even laugh. (link to the other article) In my research, it became apparent that for the duration of the quasi-experiment, teachers always allowed this kind of atmosphere. However, from the comments of participants, it was visible that if they had not done it, the atmosphere would most certainly sink.</p>

    <figure class="float-end p-3 figure">
        <img  src="../images/image003.png"  class="figure-img"  height="350" alt="table1">

    </figure>
On the other side, as seen in research by Peter A. Hastie and Andrew Pickwell (1996), such a free environment can not be offered every time. Their study discusses a social system of young students learning dance as part of their school curriculum. Moreover, it shows that most of the students were trying to avoid any dance activity for the majority of the duration of the dance class. The environment the teacher offered was not closely as relaxed and free as the one in my research. So, it can be assumed that if it had been, the students would just take advantage of it and would not dance at all. It is necessary to mention that these students were 16-17 years old and members of the 11th grade (Hastie & Pickwell, 1996). In comparison to that, the participants of my study were all over 18 years old and were not part of any compulsory dance activities (see tab. 2).</p>

<p>For dancers feeling relaxed and happy is necessary not to feel embarrassed. Which, unfortunately, happens quite often in dance classes (Peter A. Hastie and Andrew Pickwell, 1996). Dancers can frequently be nervous, scared, or pressured to do well (Frichtel, 2017; Sobash, 2012). Especially if they think they are worse than the rest of the group. This has already been commented on in the first section of this article by participant 4 (link to that section). Likely, it is noticeable from participant 2 sharing his previous dance learning experiences: 'Everyone in the class has been above...level above...or just high level. And so then you feel like not as good, I guess. You feel a bit nervous.'</p>

<p>It might seem that this feeling of being a poor dancer appears even more often in a mixed-level class because the level of dancing is much broader. Nevertheless, it does not have to. My research shows that those feelings weaken or even completely evaporate if everyone in the dance class has someone in a similar situation. This research was full of participants of various dance levels, where each beginner or advanced dancer had at least one other person on the same level (see tab. 1). And that's precisely it. The research showed that if each person in the class has another one in the same situation, they can discuss it and laugh about it together rather than be crunching alone in the corner trying to hide from all the 'super-trained' advanced dancers. Therefore, I suggest that in a mixed-level dance class, there should always be at least two people of one' dance level' so that everybody has a buddy.</p>

<p>The only exception for not suffering this 'poor dancer' complex in a mixed-level dance class is the intermediate group. My research shows that because intermediate dancers find themselves somewhere in the middle of beginners and advanced dancers, they don't feel such a need for another intermediate dancer to be in the same class with them. They do not feel as bad as, evidently, there is someone worse than them as well as better than them. Yet, I suggest this applies only to feelings of nervousness, fear and pressure. It is not clear from my research if it necessarily covers the loneliness, which might appear to a dancer at any stage of dance level without a buddy and generally influence emotional, cognitive and behavioural functioning (Taylor <em>et al.</em>, 2018; Coyle and Dugan, 2012; Holt-Lunstad <em>et al.</em>, 2010; Hawkley and Cacioppo, 2003).</p>

<p>That said, all participants in the research mentioned that they were coming to this research with a positive mindset and ready to have some fun. So even though the study shows that a mixed-level dance class can create a positive atmosphere and make dancers feel good, it is necessary to take it with a pinch of salt as not every dance class is done the same way and with the same mindset and preparation as was the one for the research purposes.</p>

<h5>Type of Research</h5>

    The methodology I chose was supportive of a social practice-based kind of research in the form of quasi-experiment (Cohen <em>et al.</em>, 2018). My research was a small-scale study Punch and Oancea (2014) that included only 8 participants, 4 men and 4 women. Those participants were adults without any health issues, coming from various dance backgrounds. The main difference between them was their age and level of dancing; among those participants, there were dance beginners, intermediate and advanced dancers, as well as people from 21 to 56 years old (see tab. 3). Plus, all of them received an information sheet (see pic. 2) and consent form (see pic. 3) before the quasi-experiment started.

    </figure></a>
    My research was also qualitative, as the research methods aligned with attaining qualitative data. I used methods such as observation, literature review, intervention, pre-test questionnaire (including only details like age, occupancy, previous dance experience etc.), video recording (recording of the dance classes, just for the researcher to go back to if needed) and focus group discussion (Atkinson <em>et al.</em>, 2021, Kara, 2020, Cohen <em>et al.</em>, 2018, Mason, 2018). These methods together gave me a good amount of data to go through. For that, I used two cycles of coding (Miles <em>et al.</em>, 2020). In the first cycle, I applied holistic coding of data (Saldaña, 2021; Miles <em>et al.</em>, 2020) and created 11 potential themes. In the second cycle, I used a concept code, which allowed me to 'transcend particular of the study to more abstract or generalizable contexts' (Miles <em>et al.</em>, 2020, p.66). During the whole coding process, I was also aware of and worked with In Vivo coding, Process coding, Descriptive coding, Emotion coding and Versus coding (Saldaña, 2021). Initially, I was also planning to pattern code, but as I later decided to apply thematic analyses of the data, which supports the realist approach and does not believe that any standard procedures and rules help the final validity of the analyses (Wiltshire & Ronkainen, 2021), I opted to avoid pattern coding. Meanwhile, on the side, I was also using techniques such as jotting and analytical memoing (Wiltshire & Ronkainen, 2021). Plus, when I got to the dissemination part of my research project, I also planned and created a website for my blog/research article, which is possible to open and see in a pc or mobile version (see pic. 4).</p>

<p>The research project was led as a quasi-experiment (Cohen <em>et al.</em>, 2018) and consisted of four dance classes and an intervention in between. Two of those classes were ballet, and two were hip hop. The duration of each class was 30 minutes. Ballet classes were taught by me [the researcher], while the hip hop classes were taught by another dance teacher, one of the participants. All dance classes, as well as the intervention part of the study, took place in a dance studio.</p>

<p>The intervention part of the quasi-experiment was done through the focus group discussion and sharing of ideas, notes and inclusive and other teaching theories. To give an example, one of the theories used was a theory by a well-known dance researcher Jessica Zeller:</p>

<ul>
    <li>One of the ways how to decline from an authoritarian style of teaching is to proceed with more inclusive, nurturing and humanising pedagogy through collaborative interaction with students, turning them into teachers' partners (Zeller, 2019).</li>

    <li>Another theory was taken from an article, 'Culture of Basic Goodness' - Examining Factors that Contribute to Student Success and Sense of Place in Undergraduate Dance Major Programs, written by Christi Camper Moore (2021). Moore (2021) was searching for ways how to build a community while pursuing the success of students within an undergraduate program specialised in dance. The theory she used was in the form of 'what if' questions, which I followingly used for my own research. These sound as follows:
        <br><br>
        <blockquote class="ps-5">What if there are practices (pedagogical, theoretical, curricular) that students identify as part of a healthy, supportive collegiate dance program? What if student experiences inform curricular shifts or develop strategies that better support inclusion? What if dance education could better facilitate more collaboration with one's peers? What if a more purposeful inclusion of student voice in the development and stewardship of a dance program could enhance/amplify/maximize both the experience of undergraduate students and the vitality of dance in higher education?
            <p class="text-end"> (Moore, 2021)</p> </blockquote>
    </li>

    <li>The third theory was inspired by Li Wang (2020), who offers a few ways to apply inclusive teaching methods. Specifically: Teachers should communicate with the students more, solve problems together, pay more attention to cultural sensitivity and support dialogues and overall collaboration (Wang, 2020).</li>

    <li>Following that, there was the fourth theory by Catherine Bovill (2019), which is very similar to the one of Wang (2020). With the purpose of a whole class approach while enhancing inclusiveness in higher education, Bovill (2019) offers co-collaboration and co-creation techniques such as deepening relationships between the participants in the dance class, including the teacher.</li>

    <li>The last and most likely the most significant theory evolves around the 'removing barrier' idea, which is one of the inclusive practices applicable to a dance class (Needham-Beck & Aujla, 2020). It ensures that all participants in the dance class have an opportunity to dance (Urmston & Aujla, 2021; Amans, 2017).</li>

</ul>

<p>Overall, all of these theories were thoroughly discussed and commented on. Thanks to them, many views on the research topic were collected. Plus, thanks to the focus group discussion and video recording, the researcher could also compare the difference these theories made between each dance style's first and second dance class.</p>

<h5>Critical evaluation</h5>

<p>Firstly, to critically evaluate my research process, I must admit that I am not entirely sure of the participants' believability of the answers. This is because, during my analytical memoing and jotting process of coding (Wiltshire & Ronkainen, 2021), I discovered that some information varies from the one I got before. To give an example: When one of my participants was coming to the experiment, and we had a casual chat together, the participant said that he/she was pretty nervous about doing the quasi-experiment, as there would be new people, a new environment and that he/she is simply very curious how it will go. He/she said that it would most likely be fun, but it still creates some anxiety for him/her. But, during the focus group discussion, I, as a researcher, asked if anyone was nervous before coming to this experiment and how the participants felt about it overall. He/she then claimed that there was no nervousness whatsoever and that he/she felt only excited about it and thought that it was like any other class he/she was part of. I assume that this might be because no participant wants to look scared and ´weak´ in front of others and the overall group situation might influence the answers of individuals (Gill <em>et al.</em>, 2008). Therefore, during a more private discussion only with the researcher, there is a stronger possibility that the actual truth was told, while during the conversation with all the other participants, the truth might appear modified. Another case, which would explain why the answers of this participant varied, is the fact that focus group discussion took part between the dance classes, while the informal chat with me before the quasi-experiment started. Suggesting that the participant might have gotten carried away with the whole study atmosphere and during the process forgot about the state anxiety (MacIntyre & Gardner, 1991), which appeared only at that particular moment before the quasi-experiment had started. Either way, I shall be more cautious about similar situations in my future research process. To prevent these, I might choose to proceed either with a one-on-one discussion (Gill <em>et al.</em>, 2008) or with the focus group discussion with all the participants (Kara, 2020; Mason, 2018), as well as a more private one-on-one interview with each participant separately. This way, I should hopefully attain more genuine and accurate answers.</p>

<p>Secondly, there was a time issue. Some participants commented that they felt like especially the hip hop class was rushed as it was only 30 minutes long and there was not as much time as there would have been during a typical regular dance class. Consequently, it influenced some of their answers and comments during the focus group discussion. Plus, there was not much time to try out all the inclusive possibilities when teaching a dance class. Therefore, for future study, I would definitely opt to make the dance classes of a similar length to the usual ones, but I would choose to proceed only with one dance style. Even though having the comparison between ballet and hip hop when researching my topic was interesting and brought some ideas, I eventually did not actually need or use any of them. I think it would be more beneficial to do two different projects when one of them would be more focused on a ballet versus hip hop theme while the other one would be more concerned about the mixed-level dance class and inclusion topic.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, for my own professional teaching practice, I am taking away a lot of new ideas. The main one is that without stress and with a positive atmosphere, learning as well as teaching is easier and more enjoyable. Therefore, in my future dance teaching, I will try to be even more open-minded and will support students in a way so that they can observe and help each other. Indeed, I now believe that each student has their own pace and learning strategy and that I will never tell my dancers off for ´copying´ each other or ´talking´ during a dance class.
