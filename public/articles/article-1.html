<h3 id="methodology-and-critical-discussion">Introduction</h3>

<p>
  In today's world, there are many situations in which students from different
  backgrounds participate in the same dance classes (Wang, 2020; Ritchie &
  Gaulter, 2018; Altbach et al. 2009; Guruz 2008). This poses an enormous
  challenge to both the students and the teachers to create an inclusive,
  supportive, motivational and productive learning environment for all. Previous
  research projects investigated strategies for improving such types of mixed
  classes.
</p>

<p>
  For example, in 2020, Li Wang looked into the problematic area of
  intercultural sensitivity within dance classes. Using the Model of
  Intercultural Sensitivity (Bennett, 1986), she investigated the teachers'
  intentions and students' experiences inside the group of international
  university students. She suggested teachers' desires for inclusivity in the
  classroom do not always match the outcomes of their teaching strategies.
</p>

<p>
  Catherine Bovill (2019) put together a large amount of literature regarding student partnership and student engagement to be able to stress the importance of the co-creation of learning and teaching together with the use of a whole-class approach. She found the whole-class approach may be more inclusive
  than any other teaching method supporting inclusiveness.
</p>

<p>
  In another research, Christi Camper Moore (2021) was searching for ways how to
  build a community while pursuing the success of students within an
  undergraduate program specialised in dance. In the research, she included
  participants of ages 18-22 and of different dance levels. She searched for a
  better understanding of how dancers describe their own relationships and
  experiences. Her research revealed that ´ individual student learning is
  irrevocably embedded within communal contexts that influence students
  daily´(p.9).

<p>
  The aim of my research was to investigate the topic of inclusion in a
  mixed-level dance class environment. It included students of different skill
  levels and experiences and tested whether a focus group discussion and
  learning about inclusiveness teaching theories could potentially improve the
  feelings of inclusiveness and create a positive learning environment.

  My research was a small-scale study that included only eight participants,
  four men and four women. Those participants were adults without any health
  issues, coming from various dance backgrounds. The main difference between
  them was their age and level of dancing; among those participants, there were
  dance beginners, intermediate and advanced dancers, as well as people from 21
  to 56 years old (see tab. 1).
</p>

<p>
  All participants received an information sheet (see image 1) and signed a
  consent form (see image 2) before the quasi-experiment started.

  <h5>Design</h5>
  
  To find out what to do to make dance students feel more included in a dance class, I used a few methods. The main one was a focus group discussion (Kara, 2020; Mason, 2018), which lasted about three hours. After applying other research methods, I also applied two cycles of coding (Miles et al., 2020), jotting, analytical memoing and thematic analysis (Wiltshire & Ronkainen, 2021). Plus, when I got
  to the dissemination part of my research project and articles, I also planned and created a
  website, which is possible to open and see in a
  pc or mobile version (see image 3).
</p>

<p>
  The methodology I chose was supportive of social practice-based research in the form of quasi-experiment (Cohen et al., 2018). My research was also qualitative, as the research methods aligned with attaining qualitative data. I used observation, literature review, intervention, pre-test questionnaire (including only details like age, occupancy, previous dance experience etc.), video recording (recording of the dance classes, just for the researcher to go back to if needed) and audio recorded focus group discussion (Atkinson et al., 2021, Kara, 2020, Cohen et al., 2018, Mason, 2018). 
</p>

<p>
  The research project consisted of two dance classes (ballet and hip hop), an intervention and two more dance classes of the same styles. The duration of each dance class was 30 minutes. The ballet classes were taught by me (the researcher), while the hip hop classes were taught by another dance teacher. All these activities took place in a dance studio. After the second round of classes was finished, participants took part in a final group discussion to share their experiences.
</p>

<p>The intervention was done through a semi-structured focus group discussion. The researcher asked the participants <a target="_blank" href="../files/Focus group discussion - questions.pdf">questions</a> about how the classes made them feel; what they struggled with; how others influenced their experience; how the dance teacher attributed to the whole class atmosphere etc. (The whole list of questions can be found here). After the questions were all answered and discussed, the participants were introduced to the following inclusive teaching ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    To proceed with more inclusive, nurturing and humanising pedagogy, teachers should support collaborative interaction with students, turning them into teachers' partners (Zeller, 2019).
  </li>

  <li>
    While teaching a mixed dance class, teachers should think of the following ´What If´ questions (Moore, 2021): <br /><br />
    <blockquote class="ps-5">
      What if there are practices (pedagogical, theoretical, curricular) that
      students identify as part of a healthy, supportive collegiate dance
      program? What if student experiences inform curricular shifts or develop
      strategies that better support inclusion? What if dance education could
      better facilitate more collaboration with one's peers? What if a more
      purposeful inclusion of student voice in the development and stewardship
      of a dance program could enhance/amplify/maximize both the experience of
      undergraduate students and the vitality of dance in higher education?
      <p class="text-end">(Moore, 2021)</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>

  <li>
    To support an inclusive environment, teachers should communicate with students and solve problems cooperatively while paying more attention to cultural sensitivity (Wang, 2020).
  </li>

  <li>
    To enhance inclusiveness in higher education, Bovill (2019) offers a whole class approach and co-collaboration and co-creation techniques, such as deepening relationships between all participants, including the teacher.
  </li>

  <li>
    To offer inclusivity and therefore ensure that all participants in the dance class have an opportunity to dance (Urmston & Aujla, 2021; Amans, 2017), teachers should ´remove barriers´ within any mixed-level dance class (Needham-Beck & Aujla, 2020).
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Analysis</h3>
<p>
  To analyse the data, the discussions were transcribed verbatim. Afterwards, two cycles of coding, as discussed by Miles et al. in 2020, were used. In the first cycle, holistic coding of data (Saldaña, 2021; Miles et al., 2020) was applied, and 11 potential themes were created. In the second cycle, a concept code was used, which allowed me to 'transcend particular of the study to more abstract or generalisable contexts' (Miles et al., 2020, p.66). During the whole coding process, I was also aware of and worked with In Vivo coding, Process coding, Descriptive coding, Emotion coding and Versus coding (Saldaña, 2021).
</p>

<p>Initially, I was also planning to pattern code, but as I later decided to apply thematic analyses of the data, which supports the realist approach and does not believe that any standard procedures and rules help the final validity of the analyses (Wiltshire & Ronkainen, 2021), I opted to avoid pattern coding. Meanwhile, on the side, I was also using techniques such as jotting and analytical memoing (Wiltshire & Ronkainen, 2021).
</p>

<h3>Critical evaluation</h3>

<h5>Familiarity and Repetition</h5>

<p>
  The fact that the students did the second round of dance sessions in the same group, with the same teachers and on the same day might have influenced their feeling of inclusion. As stated by Gilson & Shalley (2004) and Pinto, Pinto & Prescott (1993), when people spend time together, they feel gradually more comfortable with each other. Therefore the effect of improved inclusiveness might have been the result of students getting to know each other better rather than the intervention. Future studies should address this issue by, for example, having a bigger sample size with more groups and swapping the participants among the groups. 
</p>

<p>
  Another consideration of this research design is that repetitive practice can improve self-efficacy, which in turn can provide a positive experience (Bandura, 1997). Therefore, having multiple practice sessions might have been another factor contributing to the result of this study rather than the intervention itself. To address this issue, a study with a larger sample size and control groups might be beneficial (Cohen et al., 2018).
</p>

<h5>Participants´ Integrity</h5>

<p>An issue with data collection is the integrity of the answers given by the participants. Firstly, for participants to share their true feelings, they should feel predisposed and comfortable. A friendly and welcoming approach was used during the discussion to encourage honest answers, but there is no actual measurement of any objective evidence of that. Secondly, group discussion where the participant has to talk in front of everyone else might have put them in a situation where they try to appear good in front of their peers, and the overall group situation might influence the answers of individuals (Gill et al., 2008).</p>

<p>For example, one of the participants prior to the experiment mentioned she was nervous, but during the group discussion, she said that she did not experience any nervousness beforehand. This could be explained either by the effect the group had on her or by the fact that the focus group discussion took part between the dance classes, while the informal chat happened before, suggesting that the participant might had gotten carried away with the whole study atmosphere and during the process had forgotten about the state anxiety (MacIntyre & Gardner, 1991), which possibly had appeared only at that particular moment.</p>

<p>Either way, future research should approach similar situations with more caution. For example, this may be done with a one-on-one discussion (Gill et al., 2008) or with both a focus group discussion with all the participants (Kara, 2020; Mason, 2018), as well as a more private one-on-one interview with each participant separately. This way, more genuine and accurate answers might be collected.<p>

<h5>Time</h5>

<p>Another critical point of this research process was the duration of the dance classes. Some participants said they felt the dance classes were rushed:</p>

<blockquote class="p-3" >Participant 3: ´I think the teachers could like demonstrated a bit more, but I think there was really no time for it today.´</blockquote>

<p>This is true, as the duration of the class did not reflect real-world dance sessions normally lasting 1-1.5 hours. Consequently, there was not much time to try out all the inclusive strategies when teaching a dance class. Future studies should strive to follow the typical length of a dance class.</p>

<p>Furthermore, choosing to proceed with only one dance style might be beneficial. This is because even though having the comparison between ballet and hip hop when researching this topic was interesting; it added an unnecessary time consumption. It might be more beneficial if future research only sticks to one dance style and increases the duration of the dance classes. If different dance styles are to be taught, they should also follow the full length of a dance class, which might provide an opportunity to have a better investigation of the inclusion differences among various dance styles.</p>

<h5>Influencing the Answers</h5>

<p>A different consideration to point out is that the researcher (myself) might have had internal biases, which could have steered the conversation towards certain answers. However, to avoid this situation, I tried to create neutral questions and also the conversation was audio recorded and transcribed verbatim (Gill et al., 2008). Finally, an external interviewer not involved with the research might be used in future studies to lead the focus group discussion in order to avoid the researcher´s influence on the participants.</p>

<h3>Influence on my personal professional teaching practice</h3>
<p>
  For my own professional teaching practice, I am taking away a
  lot of new ideas. The main one is that without stress and with a positive
  atmosphere, learning as well as teaching is easier and more enjoyable.
  Therefore, in my future dance teaching, I will try to be even more open-minded
  and will support students in a way so that they can observe and help each
  other. Indeed, I now believe that each student has their own pace and learning
  strategy and that I will never tell my dancers off for ´copying´ each other or
  ´talking´ during a dance class.
</p>

<p id="personal-impact">
  Overall, this research process helped me to realise that the more teachers
  support inclusion in their dance classes, the more positivity it will create.
  Therefore, in my future dance classes, I will aim to use some of the ideas
  proposed in this article to make my students feel comfortable and included.
  Furthermore, I do plan to value myself more as a teacher and try to transfer
  my knowledge to students while enjoying myself, having fun, laughing,
  discussing and sharing positive and relaxed energy with my students. Sometimes
  I used to feel like there was no time to have fun in the dance class. Not for
  the students and definitely not for the teacher. But this research process
  showed me that if there is fun, there is also a greater possibility that
  students will actually last and keep coming to the dance classes in the
  future. The learning process does not need to be speedy but mainly enjoyable.
  And maybe it might be more successful in the long run if I take more time in
  the class as a teacher to also be a human - to laugh, joke or talk for a bit.
</p>

<p>
  I got inspired by the variety of the dancers and their dance possibilities and
  ideas. Moreover, it also became apparent to me that a mixed-level dance class
  can be a very productive dance environment when trying to support inclusive
  practices. Therefore, in the future, I will make an effort to run open dance
  classes where dancers of all levels will be welcomed. I will observe those
  dancers and will attempt to learn from the dancers I teach. Because as it
  showed during the research process, each person offers something different and
  exciting. Different ideas about dance classes, different ways to move their
  bodies, and different ways to think about teaching or learning. It does not
  matter if the person is a beginner, intermediate or advanced dancer; everyone
  can contribute to the dance class environment and enrich others, including the
  teacher.

  </figure>
  The last point I will carry with me from now on when teaching a dance class is
  that dance is related to other disciplines such as music, technology,
  sociology, psychology and so on. I realised this through the discussion with
  the research participants, who were from totally different professional
  backgrounds (see tab. 2). Therefore, I will try to create for my students in
  the classes a bigger picture. I realised that when we discuss in the dance
  studio, it does not always have to be about dance. Other disciples help us to
  understand dance the same way dance opens our eyes to other fields. And so I
  will support this idea with my dance students in the future.
