The methodology I chose was supportive of a social practice-based kind of research in the form of quasi-experiment (Cohen
<em>et
    al.</em>, 2018). My research was a small-scale study Punch and Oancea (2014) that included only 8 participants, 4 men and 4 women. Those participants were adults without any health issues, coming from various dance backgrounds. The main difference between them was their age and level of dancing; among those participants, there were dance beginners, intermediate and advanced dancers, as well as people from 21 to 56 years old (see tab. 3). Plus, all of them received an information sheet (see pic. 2) and consent form (see pic. 3) before the quasi-experiment started.

My research was also qualitative, as the research methods aligned with attaining qualitative data. I used methods such as observation, literature review, intervention, pre-test questionnaire (including only details like age, occupancy, previous dance experience etc.), video recording (recording of the dance classes, just for the researcher to go back to if needed) and focus group discussion (Atkinson
<em>et al.</em>, 2021, Kara, 2020, Cohen <em>et
    al.</em>, 2018, Mason, 2018). These methods together gave me a good amount of data to go through. For that, I used two cycles of coding (Miles
<em>et al.</em>, 2020). In the first cycle, I applied holistic coding of data (Saldaña, 2021; Miles <em>et
    al.</em>, 2020) and created 11 potential themes. In the second cycle, I used a concept code, which allowed me to 'transcend particular of the study to more abstract or generalizable contexts' (Miles
<em>et
    al.</em>, 2020, p.66). During the whole coding process, I was also aware of and worked with In Vivo coding, Process coding, Descriptive coding, Emotion coding and Versus coding (Saldaña, 2021). Initially, I was also planning to pattern code, but as I later decided to apply thematic analyses of the data, which supports the realist approach and does not believe that any standard procedures and rules help the final validity of the analyses (Wiltshire & Ronkainen, 2021), I opted to avoid pattern coding. Meanwhile, on the side, I was also using techniques such as jotting and analytical memoing (Wiltshire & Ronkainen, 2021). Plus, when I got to the dissemination part of my research project, I also planned and created a website for my blog/research article, which is possible to open and see in a pc or mobile version (see pic. 4).</p>

<p>The research project was led as a quasi-experiment (Cohen <em>et al.</em>, 2018) and consisted of four dance classes
    and an intervention in between. Two of those classes were ballet, and two were hip hop. The duration of each class
    was 30 minutes. Ballet classes were taught by me [the researcher], while the hip hop classes were taught by another
    dance teacher, one of the participants. All dance classes, as well as the intervention part of the study, took place
    in a dance studio.</p>

<p>The intervention part of the quasi-experiment was done through the focus group discussion and sharing of ideas, notes
    and inclusive and other teaching theories. To give an example, one of the theories used was a theory by a well-known
    dance researcher Jessica Zeller:</p>

<ul>
    <li>One of the ways how to decline from an authoritarian style of teaching is to proceed with more inclusive,
        nurturing and humanising pedagogy through collaborative interaction with students, turning them into teachers'
        partners (Zeller, 2019).
    </li>

    <li>Another theory was taken from an article, 'Culture of Basic Goodness' - Examining Factors that Contribute to
        Student Success and Sense of Place in Undergraduate Dance Major Programs, written by Christi Camper Moore
        (2021). Moore (2021) was searching for ways how to build a community while pursuing the success of students
        within an undergraduate program specialised in dance. The theory she used was in the form of 'what if'
        questions, which I followingly used for my own research. These sound as follows:
        <br><br>
        <blockquote class="ps-5">What if there are practices (pedagogical, theoretical, curricular) that students
            identify as part of a healthy, supportive collegiate dance program? What if student experiences inform
            curricular shifts or develop strategies that better support inclusion? What if dance education could better
            facilitate more collaboration with one's peers? What if a more purposeful inclusion of student voice in the
            development and stewardship of a dance program could enhance/amplify/maximize both the experience of
            undergraduate students and the vitality of dance in higher education?
            <p class="text-end"> (Moore, 2021)</p></blockquote>
    </li>

    <li>The third theory was inspired by Li Wang (2020), who offers a few ways to apply inclusive teaching methods.
        Specifically: Teachers should communicate with the students more, solve problems together, pay more attention to
        cultural sensitivity and support dialogues and overall collaboration (Wang, 2020).
    </li>

    <li>Following that, there was the fourth theory by Catherine Bovill (2019), which is very similar to the one of Wang
        (2020). With the purpose of a whole class approach while enhancing inclusiveness in higher education, Bovill
        (2019) offers co-collaboration and co-creation techniques such as deepening relationships between the
        participants in the dance class, including the teacher.
    </li>

    <li>The last and most likely the most significant theory evolves around the 'removing barrier' idea, which is one of
        the inclusive practices applicable to a dance class (Needham-Beck & Aujla, 2020). It ensures that all
        participants in the dance class have an opportunity to dance (Urmston & Aujla, 2021; Amans, 2017).
    </li>

</ul>

<p>Overall, all of these theories were thoroughly discussed and commented on. Thanks to them, many views on the research
    topic were collected. Plus, thanks to the focus group discussion and video recording, the researcher could also
    compare the difference these theories made between each dance style's first and second dance class.</p>

<h5>Critical evaluation</h5>

<p>Firstly, a point to be considered for this research is that fact that the participants might not have given the right answers during the focus group discussion. For example, during my analytical memoing and jotting process of coding (Wiltshire
    & Ronkainen, 2021), I discovered that some information varies. When
    one of the participants came the experiment, and we had a casual chat together, the participant said that
    he/she was pretty nervous about doing the quasi-experiment, as there would be new people, a new environment and that
    he/she is simply very curious how it will go. He/she said that it would most likely be fun, but it still creates
    some anxiety for him/her. But, during the focus group discussion, I, as a researcher, asked if anyone was nervous
    before coming to this experiment and how the participants felt about it overall. He/she then claimed that there was
    no nervousness whatsoever and that he/she felt only excited about it and thought that it was like any other class
    he/she was part of. I assume that this might be because no participant wants to look scared and ´weak´ in front of
    others and the overall group situation might influence the answers of individuals (Gill <em>et al.</em>, 2008).
    Therefore, during a more private discussion only with the researcher, there is a stronger possibility that the
    actual truth was told, while during the conversation with all the other participants, the truth might appear
    modified. Another case, which would explain why the answers of this participant varied, is the fact that focus group
    discussion took part between the dance classes, while the informal chat with me before the quasi-experiment started.
    Suggesting that the participant might have gotten carried away with the whole study atmosphere and during the
    process forgot about the state anxiety (MacIntyre & Gardner, 1991), which appeared only at that particular moment
    before the quasi-experiment had started. Either way, I shall be more cautious about similar situations in my future
    research process. To prevent these, I might choose to proceed either with a one-on-one discussion (Gill <em>et
        al.</em>, 2008) or with the focus group discussion with all the participants (Kara, 2020; Mason, 2018), as well
    as a more private one-on-one interview with each participant separately. This way, I should hopefully attain more
    genuine and accurate answers.</p>

<p>Secondly, there was a time issue. Some participants commented that they felt like especially the hip hop class was
    rushed as it was only 30 minutes long and there was not as much time as there would have been during a typical
    regular dance class. Consequently, it influenced some of their answers and comments during the focus group
    discussion. Plus, there was not much time to try out all the inclusive possibilities when teaching a dance class.
    Therefore, for future study, I would definitely opt to make the dance classes of a similar length to the usual ones,
    but I would choose to proceed only with one dance style. Even though having the comparison between ballet and hip
    hop when researching my topic was interesting and brought some ideas, I eventually did not actually need or use any
    of them. I think it would be more beneficial to do two different projects when one of them would be more focused on
    a ballet versus hip hop theme while the other one would be more concerned about the mixed-level dance class and
    inclusion topic.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, for my own professional teaching practice, I am taking away a lot of new ideas. The main one is that
    without stress and with a positive atmosphere, learning as well as teaching is easier and more enjoyable. Therefore,
    in my future dance teaching, I will try to be even more open-minded and will support students in a way so that they
    can observe and help each other. Indeed, I now believe that each student has their own pace and learning strategy
    and that I will never tell my dancers off for ´copying´ each other or ´talking´ during a dance class. To see even
    more of how this research affected my personal professional practice in dance teaching, <a

<h3>Methodology and critical discussion of the research process</h3>

<p>To find out what to do to make dance students feel more included in a dance class, I used a few methods. The main one was a focus group discussion (Kara, 2020; Mason, 2018), which lasted about three hours. After applying other research methods, I also applied two cycles of coding (Miles <em>et al.</em>, 2020), jotting, analytical memoing and thematic analysis (Wiltshire & Ronkainen, 2021). To see the detailed description of the whole research process, <a href="/article/1#methodology-and-critical-discussion">click here.</a></p>

<p id="personal-impact">Overall, this research process helped me to realise that the more teachers support inclusion in their dance classes, the more positivity it will create. Therefore, in my future dance classes, I will aim to use some of the ideas proposed in this article to make my students feel comfortable and included. Furthermore, I do plan to value myself more as a teacher and try to transfer my knowledge to students while enjoying myself, having fun, laughing, discussing and sharing positive and relaxed energy with my students. Sometimes I used to feel like there was no time to have fun in the dance class. Not for the students and definitely not for the teacher. But this research process showed me that if there is fun, there is also a greater possibility that students will actually last and keep coming to the dance classes in the future. The learning process does not need to be speedy but mainly enjoyable. And maybe it might be more successful in the long run if I take more time in the class as a teacher to also be a human - to laugh, joke or talk for a bit.</p>

<p>I got inspired by the variety of the dancers and their dance possibilities and ideas. Moreover, it also became apparent to me that a mixed-level dance class can be a very productive dance environment when trying to support inclusive practices. Therefore, in the future, I will make an effort to run open dance classes where dancers of all levels will be welcomed. I will observe those dancers and will attempt to learn from the dancers I teach. Because as it showed during the research process, each person offers something different and exciting. Different ideas about dance classes, different ways to move their bodies, and different ways to think about teaching or learning. It does not matter if the person is a beginner, intermediate or advanced dancer; everyone can contribute to the dance class environment and enrich others, including the teacher.</p>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Table 1 - Participants´ occupation</figcaption>
    </figure>
    Another point I will carry with me from now on when teaching a dance class is that dance is related to other disciplines such as music, technology, sociology, psychology and so on. I realised this through the discussion with the research participants, who were from totally different professional backgrounds (see tab. 1). Therefore, I will try to create for my students in the classes a bigger picture. I realised that when we discuss in the dance studio, it does not always have to be about dance. Other disciples help us to understand dance the same way dance opens our eyes to other fields. And so I will support this idea with my dance students in the future.</p>

<p>A problem I found during my research process is that I might have steered the conversation toward the answers I wanted to hear during a focus group discussion with other participants. I am not sure if I really did as I truly tried not to. Plus, the discussion was tape recorded and transcribed verbatim afterwards to remove any bias (Gill <em>et al.</em>, 2008), and I also got a comment from one participant after the quasi-experiment was finished, that she thought I moderated the focus group discussion very well and even though she does not enjoy discussions, this one was actually very nice for her and she was not scared to share her ideas and opinions. But I can say it is definitely challenging to stay neutral, having done all the studying of the research topic previously to the quasi-experiment itself. Therefore, next time I would discuss my focus group discussion questions with other researchers and try to find the most neutral ones while still pointing in the direction of the topic so that the discussion does not steer entirely away from the research question.</p>

<p>Overall, the research process seemed appropriate to the research topic and, for me personally, was enjoyable. Even though there are things, which I would aim to change in future research, overall, there was no major problem during the period of this research process. Participants were all collaborating well and, similarly to me, reported that they enjoyed it and would not mind being part of another research in the future.</p>
