<h3>Offer an open environment where everyone can speak and share</h3>

<p>All participants in this research agreed that how teachers even teach the exercise or how they make the whole atmosphere in the class has a massive impact on how the class experience will affect the individual students. The class environment is influenced not only by the students but also by the teacher (Zeller, 2017; Nordin-Bates <em>et al.</em>, 2012; Quested & Duda, 2010). This research shows a few ways teachers can opt for when trying to create a pleasant environment in a dance class, followed by the rise of the students´ inclusion. The major one would definitely be the offer of a 'free space'.</p>

<p>Under the term 'free space', there is much to imagine. When hearing this term, some people may think about some kind of therapy meeting or something similar. And to be fair, it is not far from what I mean. 'Free space' in this case refers to the open, friendly and nonjudgmental environment, similar to the one supported in most therapy meetings or dance classes with rehabilitation purposes (Panagiotopoulou, 2017; Sandel & Hollander, 1995; Payne, 1992). Similarly to the idea of Chow <em>et al.</em> (2003), promoting the expansion of students´ learning through the emphasis on dialogue as a new teaching method, or the one of Na-ye Kim (2020), who encourages discussion in the classroom to support students in sharing and talking about their works to be able to evaluate and clarify them, I chose to support the idea of a ´free space´ with the purpose of creating an environment, where everyone can talk, share and discuss as much as they like. Consequently, helping students as well as the teacher to feel positive, free and included. Which then opens a wide variety of learning possibilities. As seen in a few examples mentioned below, dance students value the environment, which allows them to speak, share their ideas, laugh together, smile at each other and discuss with each other.</p>

<div class="px-5">
    <blockquote>Participant 3: 'I think when the class is freer, so when you can speak, tell your opinion, when you don't have to sit, listen, be quiet and then try to do the same thing. It is better this way. Otherwise, it might get awkward, and I think it's not that enjoyable when you are not involved in the whole process. And so I think that students should communicate with each other…hmmm…to feel involved, not just stand separately and watch the teacher.'</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Participant 4: 'As [Participant 1] said, with the moments like you are dancing and suddenly you look somewhere to another person, and he is looking back at you, and you smile at each other. That was really like a good feeling because then you wouldn't feel like you are doing something wrong, or I mean you can do it wrong, but it is not like a mocking smile. It's like it's cool, it's alright. The group was somehow connected, and when we trained it, we were collaborating with each other.'</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Participant 3: 'Yeah, sometimes we were laughing at each other because we couldn't do it. Like we were trying everybody. It was laughing in a funny way. Not like as if you are mocking that someone can't do this. And that helped the whole atmosphere in the class that everyone laughs actually. Because that means everybody enjoys it, right? And they are laughing and..yeah.'</blockquote>

    <blockquote>Participant 7: 'I think that in the ballet specifically, it was fun because like [Participant 1] said, we were trying to figure out what we have to do as a group, yeah. And me and [Participant 5], we were non-stop talking about what we are supposed to do, which leg should we use or…yeah, it was, it was really funny..yeah. And in the hip-hop, I think it was like the general atmosphere that everyone was smiling, everyone looked like they were enjoying themselves.'</blockquote>

</div>

<p>The idea here is to break from the authoritarian environment (Zeller, 2017; Lakes, 2005; Robson, Book, & Wilmerding, 2002; Smith, 1998) while supporting inclusion through a more suitable class environment as the dance class consists of mixed-level students. Plus, an inclusive dance environment is desirable as it creates a sense of belonging, which Maslow (1943) identified as one of the basic human needs. Dancers in this research were of different dance levels, which creates potential opportunities for them to feel not as comfortable in the group as we, as teachers, would like (link k druhému článku). Therefore, it requires teachers to steer away from the traditional view of power and deliver knowledge through collaborative practices and inclusive dialogues (Mayes, 2010). More progressive ways of teaching such as these can offer more benefits to the students´ and teachers´ learning, one of which is inclusion (Wang, 2020).</p>

<p>In my research, the progressive form of teaching shows as creating the ´free space´ in a dance class. It shows that if the teacher encourages students to discuss with each other, help each other, and try to sort out exercises together in a positive, free and friendly environment, it can really bring the students together and make them feel united as a group and included as an individual. This is supported by Ralph Buck and Barbara Helen Snook (2017), who also claim that through cooperative problem solving, teachers support inclusive pedagogy within their classrooms. Moreover, as my data analyses revealed, especially during the mixed-level dance class, it can bring, except for all the previously mentioned advantages, also a lot of laughter and smiles.</p>

<p>There is a catch, though! When students are allowed or even better encouraged to experience an open environment like this, teachers should not forget that they are also part of it and should proceed with appropriate behaviour and attitude (Murray, 2016). According to my research, students´ inclusion is as important as the teachers´ inclusion. Meaning the teachers not only allow and create the 'free space' but should also experience it themselves. Teachers should also let themselves be allowed to smile, discuss with students, try to maybe figure out a choreography together with students or even make jokes and laugh at them together. This statement is supported by participant 5, who commented after taking a ballet class as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="px-5">Participant 5: 'I think the teacher should also be involved in this community, talking and having fun. He/She needs to know what students think, so he/she needs to be involved in this talking process. So that he/she can respond to it or adjust something. Because, yeah, I think the main goal of the teacher needs to be to support the group's happiness, excitement and motivation to learn. Which then makes him/her happy too, right? So the dance class is not just about the dancers but also about the teacher. And about the teacher's happiness and satisfaction.'</blockquote>

<p>But now, how to reach this presumably perfect dance teaching and learning environment in an actual dance class consisting of beginners, intermediate and advanced dancers. If teaching, for example, a ballet class, the first option would be to stir the different levels of dancers between each other. If working by the barre, this research showed that it is beneficial to place a beginner next to the advanced dancer, as beginners observe and learn from the advanced dancers. They can also discuss with each other any exercise given. However, there is also an advantage in placing the same level of dancers next to each other. This is because, as seen from the comments above, dancers love to chat with each other about the exercise and potentially laugh about it in case it is too difficult for them. They tend to support each other because they feel they are in the same boat. And that is precisely it. Hello, Inclusion!</p>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Picture 1 - Participant 1 showing a exercise to others</figcaption>
    </figure>
    Then, to make advanced students feel more included, use the knowledge they already have from their previous training and let them share it with the rest of the class. For example, in a ballet class, I asked participant 1 if she wanted to show the others how that specific exercise we were working on should be done. More precisely, she was supposed to show what a dancer should think about when executing such an exercise (see pic. 1). Following this, there was a discussion with other class members, sharing their points and other ideas. In the conversation after the dance class, participant 1 described this experience as follows: 'And then once you were like in the..was it a tendu thing? We did a Ronde de jambe just off the floor with the flexed foot. There you were like asking me what to think about there, what to focus on..and that was quite nice. I mean not that I do everything perfectly of course, but you know I guess I have like, of course, quite some knowledge and there I could share with some more beginner people. Hmmm. And that was nice. That made me feel really like part of the class.´</p>

<p>Overall, these are ideas which revealed themselves after data analyses of this research. However, more research should be done to find out further tactics dance teachers could apply in their classrooms to make their various dance level students feel included. Furthermore, it is clear that teachers are part of the teaching and learning environment and should think about themselves that way. Include themselves in the practices and not separate themselves from the students. Lastly, it shows that the whole classroom collaboration and discussion support a positive learning environment and, therefore, also inclusion.</p>

<h3>Methodology and critical discussion of the research process</h3>

<p>To find out what to do to make dance students feel more included in a dance class, I used a few methods. The main one was a focus group discussion (Kara, 2020; Mason, 2018), which lasted about three hours. After applying other research methods, I also applied two cycles of coding (Miles <em>et al.</em>, 2020), jotting, analytical memoing and thematic analysis (Wiltshire & Ronkainen, 2021). To see the detailed description of the whole research process, <a href="/article/1#methodology-and-critical-discussion">click here.</a></p>

<p id="personal-impact">Overall, this research process helped me to realise that the more teachers support inclusion in their dance classes, the more positivity it will create. Therefore, in my future dance classes, I will aim to use some of the ideas proposed in this article to make my students feel comfortable and included. Furthermore, I do plan to value myself more as a teacher and try to transfer my knowledge to students while enjoying myself, having fun, laughing, discussing and sharing positive and relaxed energy with my students. Sometimes I used to feel like there was no time to have fun in the dance class. Not for the students and definitely not for the teacher. But this research process showed me that if there is fun, there is also a greater possibility that students will actually last and keep coming to the dance classes in the future. The learning process does not need to be speedy but mainly enjoyable. And maybe it might be more successful in the long run if I take more time in the class as a teacher to also be a human - to laugh, joke or talk for a bit.</p>

<p>I got inspired by the variety of the dancers and their dance possibilities and ideas. Moreover, it also became apparent to me that a mixed-level dance class can be a very productive dance environment when trying to support inclusive practices. Therefore, in the future, I will make an effort to run open dance classes where dancers of all levels will be welcomed. I will observe those dancers and will attempt to learn from the dancers I teach. Because as it showed during the research process, each person offers something different and exciting. Different ideas about dance classes, different ways to move their bodies, and different ways to think about teaching or learning. It does not matter if the person is a beginner, intermediate or advanced dancer; everyone can contribute to the dance class environment and enrich others, including the teacher.</p>

        <figcaption class="figure-caption">Table 1 - Participants´ occupation</figcaption>
    </figure>
    Another point I will carry with me from now on when teaching a dance class is that dance is related to other disciplines such as music, technology, sociology, psychology and so on. I realised this through the discussion with the research participants, who were from totally different professional backgrounds (see tab. 1). Therefore, I will try to create for my students in the classes a bigger picture. I realised that when we discuss in the dance studio, it does not always have to be about dance. Other disciples help us to understand dance the same way dance opens our eyes to other fields. And so I will support this idea with my dance students in the future.</p>

<p>A problem I found during my research process is that I might have steered the conversation toward the answers I wanted to hear during a focus group discussion with other participants. I am not sure if I really did as I truly tried not to. Plus, the discussion was tape recorded and transcribed verbatim afterwards to remove any bias (Gill <em>et al.</em>, 2008), and I also got a comment from one participant after the quasi-experiment was finished, that she thought I moderated the focus group discussion very well and even though she does not enjoy discussions, this one was actually very nice for her and she was not scared to share her ideas and opinions. But I can say it is definitely challenging to stay neutral, having done all the studying of the research topic previously to the quasi-experiment itself. Therefore, next time I would discuss my focus group discussion questions with other researchers and try to find the most neutral ones while still pointing in the direction of the topic so that the discussion does not steer entirely away from the research question.</p>

<p>Overall, the research process seemed appropriate to the research topic and, for me personally, was enjoyable. Even though there are things, which I would aim to change in future research, overall, there was no major problem during the period of this research process. Participants were all collaborating well and, similarly to me, reported that they enjoyed it and would not mind being part of another research in the future.</p>
